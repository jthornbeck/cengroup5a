Hello ____,

My name is Chris Brown and I am one of the students who will be working with you ____and your company?____ to make your ____app and/or website____ a successful project. Other students who will be working with me are Jefferey Hornbeck, Kurt Grossnickle, James Gruber, Megan Quach, Lisbeth Cardoso, and Maximilano Ronda. We are 4th and 5th year students taking the Software Engineering course taught by Dr. Christina Gardner-McCune. 

On my team, we have established that I will be the team member who is the liaison between the team and you to keep a steady and clear communication system. I have also copied my other team members’ emails in case there’s a need to contact them. You will also be able to reach me at (561)685-4935.

I am emailing you to try to organize a time when we can all sit down together and discuss your project. I hope that we will be able to meet in person, but if that is not available, a skype or phone call would suffice. 

If possible, please send me a few times in the next week that you will be free to meet with us. I’ll get back to you as soon as I can with the time that will allow the most of our team to attend.
We are all looking forward to creating something that will meet, and hopefully surpass, your expectations. 

Sincerely,
Chris
